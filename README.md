# Launchbot MDL

MDL based Styleguide for Launchbot

### forked from [Material Design Lite](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite)

> An implementation of [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)
components in vanilla CSS, JS, and HTML.

Material Design Lite (MDL) lets you add a Material Design look and feel to your
static content websites. It doesn't rely on any JavaScript frameworks or
libraries. Optimized for cross-device use, gracefully degrades in older
browsers, and offers an experience that is accessible from the get-go.

## Browser Support


| IE9 | IE10 | IE11 | Chrome | Opera | Firefox | Safari | Chrome (Android) | Mobile Safari |
|-----|------|------|--------|-------|---------|--------|------------------|---------------|
| B   | A    | A    | A      | A     | A       | A      | A                | A             |

A-grade browsers are fully supported. B-grade browsers will gracefully degrade
to our CSS-only experience.
